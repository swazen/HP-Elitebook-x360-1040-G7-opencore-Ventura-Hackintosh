# HP Elitebook x360 1040 G7 Opencore Ventura Hackintosh

Inspired by olarila method by [MaLd0n](https://www.olarila.com/topic/20908-easy-fast-and-perfect-vanilla-hackintosh-clover-and-opencore-windows-linux-or-macos/) + work of [kodowiec](https://github.com/kodowiec/HP-Elitebook-x360-1040-G6-Opencore) + french tutorial by [MikaÃ«l GUILLERM](https://tinyurl.com/4buk3nrt).

I share a complete EFI/OC ready to use, you just need to adapt SMBIOS values with GenSMBIOS, i 've delete my personnal data in config.plist. 
Do not start macOS Ventura installer without moded your SMBIOS values in config.plist with GenSMBIOS otherwise it's an assured failure.

Be patient, be zen and enjoy !

## How to make your HP Elitebook x360 1040 G7 Hachintosh

1. download my [EFI.7z](https://github.com/swazen/HP-Elitebook-x360-1040-G7-opencore-Ventura-Hackintosh/blob/main/EFI.7z) archive which contains EFI/OC folder for HP EliteBook x360 1040 G7 and extract where you want on your windows system (hack made under Windows 11 21H2)
2. download Ventura raw image on [olarila.com](https://direct-link.net/462274/olarila-ventura-final-mf) and unzip
3. download [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) for generate your personnal MacbookPro16.1 SMBIOS and unzip
4. open GenSMBIOS.bat and choose option 1 for update the mac database, and 2 for select config.plist stocked in EFI/OC folder by dragndrop and finally option 3 for generate SMBIOS infos in the config.plist selected. Choose MacbookPro16.1 for generate yours serial, board serial, SmUUID and Apple ROM.
5. download [balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), install it and flash the raw image of ventura on USB stick or drive (min 16Go). Stay your USB drive connected.
6. download [minitool partition wizard](https://www.minitool.fr/gestionnaire-partition/partition-wizard-accueil.html), install it and assign a letter to EFI partition of your USB drive for mount it.
7. download [explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/download), run it with admin privileges, delete EFI folder on EFI partition and past your EFI folder (which contains BOOT and OC).
8. reboot and press Esc/F10 to enter bios settings, go security tabs and desactivate sure start and secure start, go advanced tabs and unchek HP Sure recover, wake on lan and fix video memory to 64Mo and desactivate power management. Save and exit.

## Post install
* patches are allready installed but you need put your EFI folder on your SSD for start your hackintosh without USB drive. Exist many macOS app for mount EFI like [ESP mounter pro](https://www.olarila.com/files/Utils/ESP%20Mounter%20Pro.app_v1.9.1.zip). Just mount both EFIs partitions, delete folder EFI on SSD, copy USB EFI folder and paste on SSD.
* for wifi, download and install [Heliport](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort) and switch off native wifi.
* for a native scaled display (vectorial) you must download and install [one-key-hidpi](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi).
